# üå¶Ô∏è tiny-weather-station 

Small-scale system for measuring, storing and presenting weather data

This project enables real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity using an ESP32 microcontroller, a DHT11 sensor, and Firebase for cloud storage. The React-based frontend dynamically displays sensor data, allowing users to toggle between temperature and humidity readings.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure WiFi credentials and Firebase settings in the ESP32 code.
3. Deploy the ESP32 firmware.
4. Run the React frontend and visualize real-time sensor data.
